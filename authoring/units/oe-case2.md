# Unit: oe-case2

Course: **A7 Search, Evolution & Self-Improving Agents** (id `oe`, folder `open-ended/`).

## Course brief
A7 covers search and open-endedness: bandits/MCTS, evolutionary algorithms, novelty search, quality-diversity/MAP-Elites, POET, OMNI/OMNI-EPIC, Voyager, inference-time search (best-of-n, self-consistency, AB-MCTS), FunSearch, AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve and ShinkaEvolve, prompt/pipeline evolution (EvoPrompt, PromptBreeder, DSPy optimisers), ADAS/Meta Agent Search, the Darwin Gödel Machine, The AI Scientist, evaluator and reward hacking (including the AI CUDA Engineer episode), held-out evaluation, safety of self-modifying systems, and search in real products. Verified arXiv ids from planning: MAP-Elites 1504.04909, POET 1901.01753, AI-GAs 1905.10985, Voyager 2305.16291, Eureka 2310.12931, OMNI-EPIC 2405.15568, ADAS 2408.08435, AB-MCTS 2503.04412, DGM 2505.22954, AlphaEvolve 2506.13131, ALE-Bench 2506.09050, ShinkaEvolve 2509.19349 (check others). Sakana AI's work is prominent here; present it on its merits alongside DeepMind, Uber AI, Jeff Clune's and Kenneth Stanley's lines. Runnable examples in pure Python with seeded randomness; anywhere an LLM is the mutation operator, use a deterministic stand-in mutation function and say so.

## Your assignment: case studies

- `open-ended/cases/case-05-voyager.html` (data-case `C5`) · **Voyager in Minecraft** · pattern: Skill libraries · A lifelong agent that wrote its own curriculum and kept its skills as code. Related: 07.
- `open-ended/cases/case-06-darwin-godel-machine.html` (data-case `C6`) · **The Darwin Gödel Machine** · pattern: Open-ended self-improvement · A coding agent that rewrote its own tools, and the objective hacking its authors reported. Related: 13, 17.
- `open-ended/cases/case-07-ai-scientist.html` (data-case `C7`) · **The AI Scientist and Peer Review** · pattern: Automating the research loop · Generated papers, an automated reviewer and a workshop submission, read with care. Related: 14, 15.

Read the primary sources first (guide section 9). If a case's premise turns out to be wrong or unverifiable after research, write the best accurate version and flag it in your report.

## Process
1. Read `authoring/guide.md` in full, then the sample pages it lists for your page type. Skim `authoring/link-index.md` for this course and the courses it builds on, so your links and scope fit the neighbouring pages.
2. Research what you need (WebSearch/WebFetch), especially anything dated, numeric or from 2024 onwards. Use `$TMPDIR/oe-case2/` for scripts (create it; other authors share `$TMPDIR`).
3. Write the pages. Run every code example and paste real output. Draw diagrams carefully (no overlapping text).
4. Run `python3 authoring/check_page.py <your files>` and fix all ERRORs and reasonable WARNs.
5. Report back in under 200 words (see guide section 14). Work only on the files listed here (plus glossary-src files, widget files named with your course id plus chapter id, and lab code folders you own).
